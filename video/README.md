EUMETCastVideo
==============

Standalone app that allows for creating video's from the Eumetcast transmissions, EUMETSATâ€™s primary dissemination mechanism for the near real-time delivery of satellite images.

The app uses an xml file for the needed parameters.
For the moment the app processes data (XRIT data files) from Meteosat-11/-10/-8.
The video itself is created with ffmpeg.
